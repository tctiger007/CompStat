    In this project, we developed and implemented a Gibbs sampling method for restoring noisy gray-scale image. We explored the model correctness with different observed data: original image with Gaussian noise and a true mean value of the original image. Moreover, we experiment with different parameter settings.  More specifically, with differnet order of Markov neighbor and variance of our model. The result shows that with proper parameter setting, we are able to restore the image with a reasonale result.
