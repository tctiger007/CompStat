    In this project, we developed and implemented Gibbs sampling for restoring a noisy gray-scale image. 
    We compared the restored images with different observed data that were sampled as initial starting images, i.e., the original image with Gaussian scheme, and the image equal to the true posterior mean pixel color.
    Additionally, we compared the Gibbs samplers with different parameter settings, specifically with different Markov neighborhood order and variance of the model. 
    We have shown that the initial starting images sampled is not playing a significant role in image restoration, and the difference between differing choice of neighborhood is suttle; however, the variance of the model influences the sampled images greatly.
