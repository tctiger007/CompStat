Since this is a group project, we are working on different parts of it. Here is the detailed work we have done separately:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Niloufar Dousti Mousavi: Draft of model proof in deviriation and appendix.
	\item Wangfei Wang: Project report draft, experiment analysis, final review and proofread of the final version.
	\item Yanzi Jin: Code for the experiment, reorganize the repoer after the first draft, reformulate the proof and correct the typos in the proof in the derivation and appendix.
\end{itemize}
